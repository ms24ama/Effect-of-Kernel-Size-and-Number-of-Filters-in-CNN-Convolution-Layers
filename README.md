# Effect-of-Kernel-Size-and-Number-of-Filters-in-CNN-Convolution-Layers
This project analyses how kernel size and filter count affect CNN performance using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Different architectures are compared through training and validation metrics to evaluate feature learning, generalisation, and overfitting behaviour.
